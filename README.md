# Angular Research App
### Michael Pikula

This is a front-end-only web app, taking the form of a collection of smaller pages. It was created for the purpose of learning and understanding Angular, including but not limited to routing, component composition, component communication, and forms.

## To run app locally:
1) Install Node and the Angular CLI using [this walkthrough](https://angular.dev/tools/cli/setup-local).
2) From root of project, navigate to research-app and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3) Run `ng serve` to run the app locally (to quit, you can enter q in the terminal).
4) Navigate to `localhost:4200` on your web browser of choice.
